Description: A Bayesian repulsive biclustering method that can simultaneously cluster the Periodontal diseases (PD) patients and their tooth sites after taking the patient- and site-level covariates into consideration. BAREB uses the determinantal point process (DPP) prior to induce diversity among different biclusters to faciliate parsimony and interpretability. Essentially, BAREB is a cluster-wise linear model.
